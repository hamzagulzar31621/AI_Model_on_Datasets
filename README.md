Description

This project delves into the effectiveness of diverse machine learning algorithms on various data types: images, text, and numerical data. It implements and compares the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), ensemble methods (basic and improved), and optionally explores other relevant techniques.

Datasets

The project utilizes three datasets:

Malicious URL Detection:
This dataset aims to identify malicious URLs within a larger collection.
Consider including the source of the dataset  for transparency.
Age Detection Dataset:
This dataset focuses on predicting the age of individuals based on visual features.
If applicable, specify if the dataset contains images of faces or other body parts.
Indicate the source of the dataset .
Weather Prediction:
This dataset encompasses numerical weather data used to predict future weather conditions.
Mention the specific weather variables included (e.g., temperature, precipitation, humidity).
Indicate the source of the dataset .
Algorithms

The project implements and evaluates the following algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric supervised learning method for classification and regression. It predicts the class or value of a data point based on the k nearest neighbors in the training data.
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A feedforward artificial neural network with multiple layers of hidden units. It's a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships and non-linearities in data.
Ensemble Methods: Strategies that combine multiple models to create a more robust and accurate predictor.
Basic Ensemble: (Specify the basic ensemble method, e.g., bagging, voting classifier).
Improved Ensemble: (Describe the approach taken to improve the basic ensemble, e.g., feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning).
Jupyter Notebooks

The project includes Jupyter Notebook files for each data type and algorithm combination:

knn_malicious_url.ipynb: KNN applied to malicious URL detection
mlp_age_detection.ipynb: MLP applied to age detection
ensemble_weather_prediction.ipynb: Ensemble methods (basic and improved) applied to weather prediction
(Add additional notebooks for other algorithms/datasets)
Running the Notebooks

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python (3) and the necessary libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) installed. You can install them using pip install commands.
Clone the Repository: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired working directory. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git.
Navigate to Project Directory: Use cd your-repo-name to enter the project directory.
Run Notebooks: Open a Jupyter Notebook environment (e.g., jupyter notebook) and open the desired notebooks from the project directory. The code can be executed cell-by-cell or as a whole.
